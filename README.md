# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections wants us to audit the local election and provide some data and insight of a recent local congressional election. They wanted us to perform the following tasks to complete the election audit:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the total votes by county
5. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
6. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Election-Audit Summary

What is great about this file is you won't need to change it that much for future elections. As long as the csv file is in the same format and similar information is in the same columns. So as far as a business proposal, I propose that I continue to create more detailed data analysis with breakdowns of Democrat and Repbulican and use your government connections to propose similar services to other states. Any successful transactions can lead to 20% finders fee for you. Additionally, we could use this information to eventually find out what is most important to voters that would be more concrete then polling data as they might vote for candidates that have strong opinions that they align with. 

As far as further modicifications we can add categories classifying the candidates into Republican vs Democrat to give a better idea of demographic breakdown by county. Additionally we could add years and modify data to see the change in elections from year to year. With these two data points we can infer a lot of information about the voters and see if there is a shift in public opinion.
